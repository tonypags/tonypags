# Bio
I learned IT early in life, and despite my younger aversions I made a career out of it. The one skill I honed early that took me far was figuring out <b>How Computers WANTED to be Used</b>. I started with a few small jobs that allowed me to tinker and learn, and cut my teeth in the field at a couple different MSPs in Manhattan. And I read tech blogs, but only the good ones ;) 

After many years, I grew tired of the field and moved to the NOC streamlining workflows: I had a knack for it. That's when I re-discovered <b>PowerShell</b> and fell in love. 

I started acquiring ownership over a bunch of platforms at work and worked my magic on those as well. Pretty soon I grew tired of the endless stream of emergencies that MSP life consists of and moved into a NOC at an enterprise. I advanced their existing automated solutions and revamped their environment adding web pages and dashboard for a unified front-end experience.

I use my free time for my family and for rounds of disc golf. I love watching explainer videos, into topics like Physics, Philosophy, and anything in between (which is a lot!). If you made it this far, drop me a line: tony@pagliaro.co
